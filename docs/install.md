# Install zcage

zcage is a zone manager that takes advantage of the best features
and technologies from Illumos. It is intended to be  
easy to use with a simple command line syntax.   
  
  
**zcage currently only works in Omniosce https://omniosce.org/ and Dilos http://www.dilos.org** 

## Using github
  
To install from github (for stability use a released version)  

```
# git clone https://github.com/cneira/zcage.git && cd zcage && pfexec npm install -g 
```
## Required packages
 
To start creating zones the following packages are needed :
   
* cdrtools 
* brand/bhyve
* brand/kvm
* brand/lx
* brand/pkgsrc
* brand/sparse
* brand/lipkg
* system/kvm (provides qemu-img)

Scheduler should be set to FSS by default using DISPADMIN(1M)   
```bash
# dispadmin -d FSS
```



*** In Dilos you could only create dpkg zones at this point ***

```bash
# pkg install cdrtools brand/bhyve brand/kvm brand/lx brand/pkgsrc brand/sparse brand/lipkg system/kvm jq
```


***If you are running Omnios Bloody you could create pkgsrc zones, for that you 
need the following package***
   
```
# pkg install brand/pkgsrc 
```
